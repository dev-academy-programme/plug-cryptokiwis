# A starter project with Sass

This is a very basic base for any project that you want to develop quickly with Sass.


To start a new project:
  * `git clone https://github.com/ushamacdonald/dev-sass.git <NEW REPO NAME HERE>`
  * `git remote remove origin`
  * `git remote add origin <NEW REPO URL HERE>`
  * `git remote -v` to see your remotes
  * `git push origin master` to push the boilerplate code to your new repo

Run the following in your terminal:

```sh
npm install

```

  `npm run dev` for bundling, watch and nodemon

  `npm start` only runs server (setup for heroku)


## Woohoo!
You're ready to get going!
